\section{Task 1: Tuple-relational calculus expression}
(1) Return the name of any country that has a lake.\\
$$\{A | \ \exists L \in geo\_lake \ \exists C \in country \ ( L.country = C.code \ \wedge\ A.name=C.name) \}$$
(2)Return all the information available on cities whose population is between 3 and 5 million inhabitants.
$$\{C | \  C \in city \ ( C.populatoin>3000000 \ \wedge\ C.population<5000000) \}$$
(3)Return the country code and the continent of every country not in Europe or in Australia/Oceania.
$$\{A | \exists  C \in country \  \exists cont \in continent ( C.code=cont.country \ $$$$\wedge\  cont.continent \neq 'Europe' \ \wedge\ cont.continent \neq 'Australia/Oceania' ) \}$$
(4)Return the names of countries that also give their name a province.
$$\{A | \ \exists C \in country \ \exists P \in province ( C.code=P.country \ \wedge\ C.name=P.name \ \wedge\ A.name=C.name) \}$$
(5)Return countries that are not landlocked (i.e., have a sea coast).
$$\{A | \ \exists C \in country \ \exists S \in geo\_sea ( C.code=S.country \ \wedge\ A.name=C.name) \}$$

\section{Task 2: Relational-algebraic expression}
(6)Return countries that are not landlocked (i.e., have a sea coast).
$$ \backslash project\_\{name\} \ (\backslash project\_\{name, \ code\}\  country \  \backslash join\_ \{country=code\} \ geo\_sea);$$
(7)Return the names of all lakes, rivers and seas.
$$ \backslash rename\_\{ L\_R\_S\_names\} (  \backslash project\_\{name\} \ lake) $$$$ \backslash union ( \backslash project\_\{name\} \ river) \ \backslash union \   ( \backslash project\_\{name\} \ sea);$$
(8)Return the average length of a river.
$$ \backslash project\_\{avg(length)\} \ river;$$
(9)Return the name of countries that have more than 10 islands.
$$\pi_{name, \ num\_island} \  ( \sigma_{code=country \ \wedge \ num\_island>10} $$$$ ( _{country} \gamma_{count(island) \rightarrow num\_island } (geo\_island ) \ \bowtie  \ country ) )$$
\newpage
(10)Return the length of all rivers in Great Britain.
$$ \backslash project\_\{rname, \ length\}  \backslash select\_\{country = 'GB'\} $$$$ \ ( \backslash rename\_\{rname, \ length\} \   \backslash project\_\{name, \  length\} \ river $$$$  \backslash join $$$$  \backslash rename\_\{rname, \  country\}  \backslash project\_\{river, \ country\} \ geo\_river);$$
(11)Return the name of the countries that have the 10 longest total length of rivers.
$$\pi_{countryname \ limit \ 10}( $$$$
\tau _{length}(
_{countryname} \gamma _{sum(length) \rightarrow length}( $$$$ 
\sigma_{name=river}(
river\bowtie $$$$
\pi_{country.name\rightarrow countryname, river}( $$$$
\sigma_{country=code}(
geo\_river \bowtie country))))))$$
Question (6),(7),(8), and (10) were executed via the RA software, and their output were printed in file:\\ \textit{"Lei\_Liu\_LW1\_RA\_Result.txt"}.
\section{Task 3: SQL expression}
(12)Return the names of up to 10 countries and the value corresponding to half the country’s population.$$select \ name, \ (population/2) \  as \ half\_of\_population \ 
from \ country \ limit \ 10;$$
(13)Return all the information available about cities whose name is Manchester.$$select \ * \ from \ city \ where \ name\ =\ 'Manchester';$$
(14)Return the name of cities whose name starts with the substring 'Man’.$$select \ name \ from \ city \ where \ name \ like \ 'Man\%';$$
(15)Return the name of both countries with Buddhist populations and organizations, established after 1st December 1994, that the country is a member of.
$$select \ c.name \ as \ country, \  organization \ from \ country \ c \ join \ $$ $$(select \ distinct \ m.country \ as \ country\_code, \ o.name \ as \ organization \ 	$$$$from \ organization \ o \ join \ ismember \ m \ on \ m.organization=o.abbreviation \ $$ $$where \ o.established > '1994-12-01' \ and \ m.country \ in \ $$ $$( \ select \ country \ from \ religion \ where \ name='Buddhist' ) ) mem $$ $$on c.code = mem.country\_code;$$
(16)Return the name of each country with the number of islands in it.
$$select \ c.name, \ count(geo.island) \ as \ num\_island \ from \ country \ c $$$$ join \ geo\_island \ geo \ on \ c.code=geo.country \ group \ by \ geo.island;$$
Executed result were logged in file: \textit{Lei\_Liu\_LW1\_SQL.log}\\
Also, the sql script file is: \textit{Lei\_Liu\_LW1\_SQL.sql}
